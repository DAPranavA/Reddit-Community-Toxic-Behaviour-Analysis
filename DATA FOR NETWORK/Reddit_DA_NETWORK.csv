Cod MW 2 = best game in the franchise, killstreaks, op guns,  noob tubes, iconic characters, memes, youtube channels growth.
Cod bo1 = second greatest, zombies, best singleplayer, gold camo, wager matches,
Cod mw3 = engine getting old, Zampella controversy, muttered down maps, still great like mw2 but nerfed so less fun, good co-op, bf had stronger title despite sales.
Cod bo2 = third-best cod, zombies, singleplayer on point, multiplayer good, lag, diamond camo 
Cod ghosts = boring, dull, slow, campy, singleplayer, unoriginal, alien mode nice but repetitive
Cod advanced warfare = interesting concept but lasted 3 months, singleplayer uninteresting, predictable, multiplayer higher skill ceiling but unfair, cosmetics coated crucially development time, that could've made a masterpiece
Cod bo3 = zombies greatness, singleplayer shit, multiplayer quickly boring, new mastery camp, once again too many cosmetics to low quality.
Cod infinite warfare= singleplayer good but no risks taken, movement clunky, way too many cosmetics, and awful quality.
Cod bo4 = place holder year, 150 hp the best idea ever, pitty it was left behind. 
Cod ww2 = generic, risk-free, but After a year of patches, ugly, pay tot to win, annoying, claustrophobic
Cod mw2019= new engine, new idea, risks taken, but once again cosmetics over quality, co-op butchered, singleplayer copied from a movie, hackers epidemic

MW grayish scale is like everywhere is constantly winter and Black Ops Iâ€™d say it like being always in Vegas.

If I had to pick between Gray or vibrant. Iâ€™d pick vibrant since itâ€™s more visually interesting. MW2019 all maps felt the same to me because they visually never stood out to me.

The game was a fuckfest of randomly thrown in garbage with random balancing. If it wasnt for AlterIWnet and Delta4One, where server rules prohibited certain loadouts or morphed the game it into a competitive environment through promod,  I wouldve dropped it much earlier and not played the 1k+ hours I did.

Painkiller, Martyrdom, Final Stand, Commando, Danger Close, One Man Army, Last Stand, Stopping Power Pro (shit perk because it out-values every other perk in its tier by default for non-meme classes, ITS 40 GOD-DAMN-PERCENT EXTRA DAMAGE), Shotguns as Secondaries, Akimbo SMGs, Harrier-Chopper-Nuke, G18 Akimbo, Model 1887 Akimbo, no RPM Cap on USP & Deagle & FAL & Barrett .50 cal, complete removal of dedicated servers..

Lets not even start with balance. The UMP was and remains the only SMG worth using due to its extremely long range, easy to control low rate of fire and high damage per hit. Id say it even outclassed the MP7 in MW3, which was way too strong for other reasons. The Magnum literally did the same thing as the Deagle with even slightly better damage, and with better iron sights, less visual recoil and generally better usability. The god damn flash grenades were worthless because stun grenades were for some reason thrown at the speed of sound, detonated upon landing and offered no counterplay, while flashes on the other hand took ages to arm and throw, there was plenty of time left to look away from them, and they didnt impair movement (which nothing should in a high paced twitch shooter).

They took CoD 4 and just added a bunch of random bullshit into it with no regard for consistency, balance, counterplay or player agency. It actively upped both the skill floor through cheesy methods of killing people with no way for them to react, while at the same time upping the skill ceiling allowing players to maximize their stomping of a public lobby to levels never seen before through the insane killstreaks and S-tier Weaponry. It was an *entertaining* model, but it was a shit one in terms of game design.

It was the â€œnewâ€ Infinity Wardâ€™s first game after the Great Activision Purge, and IW needed like two other studios help to even finish the game while they were on life support. It was an uninspired and derivative, soulless copy and paste of MW2 that wasnâ€™t nearly as good as that game or Black Ops, and it only seems alright IMO today because of the trash CoDâ€™s we grew accustomed to in the years after. Compared to those, MW3 looks alright. But it was definitely the first crack in the CoD dam. Black Ops II came out the next year as a sort of last hurrah of the golden age of Call of Duty. After that game, we entered what I call the dark times - everything from Ghosts through Black Ops 4. 

In my opinion, MW2019 was the first truly great CoD since Black Ops II, but I know half the community disagrees pretty strongly with me. Then Black Ops Cold War, while not as good as MW2019, was still better than the average â€œdark timesâ€ CoD to me. Then Vanguard kind of plunged us back into darkness.

imma keep it real, i think ghosts caught so much flak for one sole reason - the way it used the name ""ghosts."" they simply did not live up to that expectation of what the name held, and i believe with the studio in the state it was, there was no way they could, either.

and because of that...we lost the best thing cod ever did.

- every gun feels great, perfect sound design, perfect controls.
- amazing hitreg.
- unbelievably genuinely GREAT maps, with the right amount of fan favs.
- destructible, changable environments
- great modes
- amazing depth for offline/splitscreen play
- THE SLIDE, THE GAME THAT BROUGHT THE SLIDE. IT WAS SO GOOD, THAT DESPITE THE ENDLESS LOVE OF DOLPHIN DIVE, THEY HAD NO CHOICE BUT TO IMPLEMENT.
- peeking around corners!
- amazing dlc, amazing varied micros. snoop dogg.

but all of this...pales...

to extinction. extinction...is better than most zombies content. a full game takes as long as a full zombies game does, makes you work for it, and fuck ME every single SYSTEM of the game is PERFECT. perfect. muah. and we lost it all because of studio mandates im sure. all bc ""wah not zombees"" - i say that as a day 1, til the end zombies nerd.

- big explosions and a vehicle chase

Iâ€™d rather stick to 2 attachments max for WWII guns, period correct attachments for Cold War weapons, and for enough visual variety that not every gun looks the same at a glance, starting with not using every single attachment slot at one time.

I like that you can max equip a gun. It make sense, I hate an arbitrary number that says oh you canâ€™t have both a scope and a stock. The army wants its soldiers to be fortified. 

However, where it gets annoying is in the 400 attachments, with min maxing and stat changes that make one grip better than 2 other attachments. 

Red dot should red dot, extended scope should be further, extended magazines should be bigger, tripods should give you more accuracy/stability. 

Why does tape on a gun give a firepower bonus, why do I have to lookup load outs to even able to trade shots with somebody without instant dying? When itâ€™s min max optimized and metaâ€™d to hell itâ€™s just annoying trying to gunsmith, instead of a make your own, put stickers on it, fun customization place.

I know people really love 3, so I expect to get heat in these comments, but, at the time, 3 felt like a grab at the Titanfall crowd. The campaign also lost me. I understood what they were going for, but it just felt so far from CoD, especially when every other fps at the time was going for future shooter. 

I ended up just playing MW2 and 3, BO1 and 2, and AW because its advanced movement felt unique to CoD, and I was digging it. Also had a cool story. 

Now, Iâ€™ve slandered Cold War because it felt like an odd departure from MW 2019â€™s engine, but I will say, I am starting to get back into it. The campaign was dope, although I want to understand Adlerâ€™s motivations for going rogue a little bit better, and I hope that they clear it up in the next Black Ops title.",15,Pontooniak96,u0jxxd,0,04-10-2022,10,2022,10,2022,0.02170297,1,0,1,2786,0.0054,0.54

BO4 had stuff fundamentally wrong. No campaign (despite those cinematics) is an entirely wasted opportunity. EKIA instead of kills leads to an inflated Combat Record (which was poorly done anyway) and easier-to-get streaks. 

Specialists were a retrograde version of BO3's. And **fuck me**, there was just so much *cheap shit* in the game. 9-Bang, that little robot that stuns you, the shotgun flashlight, LMG fire that suppressed you and threw off your aim, the list goes on.

The only thing I can say for BO4 was that the Prestige icons were COLD and the spectator experience for the Pro scene was UNMATCHED.

Black Ops 4 Activision kept rejecting all the pitches for multiplayer and campaign and it basically lead to them needing to throw the game together in like 8 months iirc (apart from Zombies, which was actually well prepped and even had more time than ever before) and that resulted in a cut campaign and a multiplayer with lots of bugs and lots of bad balancing. Then just a few months after launch, they were pulled from post-BO4 support and pre-production of their next game to work on Cold War. 

So then Cold War was made in 2 years (albeit with a skeleton of some sorts from the original version of the game being made by Raven/Sledgehammer) and an engine that had gotten only some of the improvements granted by MW19â€™s improved engine with all the same issues of crunching and poor management at Treyarch on top of Covid-19 happening and slowing development down and the game being a launch title for the new systems and thus needing to be made available for 3 more platforms than previous games. 

That being said, Cold War was a really solid game. Itâ€™s nothing crazy, but the multiplayer was fun and maps were mostly pretty good and even though Zombies wasnâ€™t really my style in this game compared to the older games, itâ€™s still something thatâ€™s perfectly playable and relatively enjoyable, with good maps and the same solid gameplay loop",0,cerealbro1,u0jxxd,0,04-10-2022,10,2022,10,2022,0.007285065,1,0,1,2786,0,0

The sad thing about getting amazing titles like blacks ops, is that due to the huge success, most companies would like to profit as much as they can before the title drains out. Black ops, unfortunately, was a victim of this. 

Iâ€™m pretty sure their creativity was immensely impacted by Activisionâ€™s demand to make a game under the â€œblack opsâ€ title, under time constraints, while incorporating what developers believed to be profitable gaming components at the time (e.g., advanced movements similar to titanfall, operators with backgrounds like overwatch, inclusion of a battle royale like pubg and fortnite, etc.). You can tell that this was starting to happen during BO3. Had a blast with the multiplayer, honestly, but what the heck was that campaign? If BO3 had been titled something other than Black ops (idk like Futuristic Warfare) it still wouldâ€™ve worked fine. There was no reason to title it Black ops besides the fact that the name sells. 

In conclusion, at this point, for Treyarch to redeem themselves, they need to start a whole series from scratch so they are not restricted by the  bounds and chains set by the previous title.

u0jxxd,Pow67,[COD] What happened Treyarch?,455,3159,0.93,No Flair,04-10-2022,i48fwcv,"> 3 felt like a grab at the Titanfall crowd

Exactly. Titanfall was big so CoD really played up the advanced movements aspects with the exo suits. Even though they dowplayed it in BO3, it still had wall running, and a lot more airfights. 

Going from BO1 and BO2 with tight fighting, great map flow and then suddenly having to run along platforms on trees, and adding more specialist abilities. CoD has had a huge identity problem. They take aspects of other games but don't know how to make it work. Like Ghost seemed to take aspects from Battlefield with the large maps but without the player count. When they try more boots on grounds, the maps aren't great and when the maps are great, the weapons are uneven which results in one or two weapons being used. 

I remember someone explaining that Modern Warfare (2019) was a campers paradise and most maps had people just hiding and waiting but ""it's gotten better in years"" but not because the game was balanced but because everyone learned where the camping spots were so it was easier to be prepared; meaning it didn't get better, you just have to play for hundreds of hours to understand where the meta is. That's the problem with CoD now, they don't fix what's broken, they waiting for the community to adapt; now people are saying that BO4 is an amazing game? They've just adapted.",1,CapablePerformance,i46eu5i,1,04-11-2022,10,2022,11,2022,0.025482707,1,0,1,2786,0.0004,0.04
u0jxxd,Pow67,[COD] What happened Treyarch?,455,3159,0.93,No Flair,04-10-2022,i49gkan,"Same. Only thing I give BO3 credit for is the coop campaign so that you and your friends could suffer together. My brother and I played it coop through, and we were struggling. We felt so disconnected from what was happening, and the story just kept dragging on and on and on.

Couldn't get into the MP either. Movement seemed like such a gimmick for the MP because outside of a flank wallrun here and there, there wasn't a lot of opportunities to utilize it on the maps, especially later compared to IW and ESPECIALLY Titanfall. For a system they called chainlink movement, I felt like there wasn't a whole lot of chains to link. Specialist felt like another gimmick only serving to provide free streaks to people that couldn't go on them. I just couldn't understand how people were willing to die by BO3's MP but be willing to torch IW even though it was just BO3 with smoother movement and more balance specialist with more utility. One of my friend's was absolutely losing it over the DLC map it had that took place on the giant picnic table but wouldn't even give the IW open beta a try because fighting on the moon was too unrealistic.

I'll say that Zombies was objectively brilliant even though it wasn't my taste. I can see why the zombies community adore it although personally I didn't enjoy how forced the story easter eggs were. I prefer easter eggs being a side thing to do and completely optional and not being forced to complete them just to open up the map. I just want to explore the map without being forced to stand in this sport and get kills when a zombie gets close to you to steal their souls and then deliver to this place, and now do it again 5 more times, and now congrats, you have one piece to get PaP. To get the other you have to kill Satan.",1,SeaGL_Gaming,i46eu5i,1,04-11-2022,10,2022,11,2022,0.002268333,1,0,1,2786,0.0004,0.04

 Every. Single. Menu. in mw, coldwar and vanguard is the same boring font, and someone decided that these menus needed to be in every aspect of zombies... 

There's no resources to manage, you can sprint as far as you want and load your gun up with every attachment because ""go ham, we only care about warzone"" so multiplayer modes are unbalanced and take no brain cells. 

The remake and reused asset issues were there in blops â´ zombies but I just wanted new locations for zombies to happen in and, say what you will, boâ´ definitely did that.. (remember when we were all hyped up about a Paris map? We've since got experiences in a gladiator colosseum and on the actual titanic and battling , was it, Perseus?idr but epic) 

The remade aether maps were still solid but they were all like Â½ to â…“ a map we've seen before. I think the vibe that we were supposed to had been to these areas before was kinda lost on a lot of people. Those places, story wise, were supposed to feel  familiar..but I digress...

 All of it's issues aside, it doesn't have menus to buy perks, it doesn't have menus to pap your weapon, and I love that! I dug the stress of getting jug on origins and the possibility of loosing your weapon in the pap machine, or randomness of the buff it gave you and without that same boring mwÂ¹â¹ font.. it's fine for one game or a series of games themed similarly, but every single menu since?? It's weird and it's everywhere, all over outbreak, warzone, and zombies mode of the last 3 games ..  Also if reused assets piss you off, iirc, the ultimate zombies camo in coldwar was the mozu MKii camo from blops â´.

I can't not mention the color.. BO4 was vibrant like it had 3x the colors to use in comparison to the newer titles.

It helps that it has loads of content (which Vanguard seems to be lacking, but they're only in their second season, so I'll cut them some slack).

What if you could earn super rare skins only from unlocking them through challenges  One example I can think of off the top of my head is If my blue dot reticle on my holo sites was an NFT, if I were able to sell it to someone at a price they were willing to pay, I bet it would be a decent penny.

I imagine this will be almost the exact same as the micro transaction available in the store yet you would actually own everything and have full autonomy so buy and sell individual products. 

For example if you bought a bundle specifically for a type of gun yet it came with a skin you didnâ€™t care for. You can then sell that skin and make some money back.

Also activision is responsible for the decision to compile these games onto each other with warzone. Not that I didnâ€™t appreciate warzone, but it should just be a separate game. They turned MW2019 into a mess (since I last played).

NFTs wonâ€™t â€œimprove the gameâ€ as in stopping cheats or better SSMM but instead give a lot more power to the individual accounts. 

Any items you buy in store, including bundles, will be individual NFTs so if you buy a bundle just for the gun but it comes with a skin you donâ€™t want/like you can sell the skin and make some money back. 

Also any items earned in game or given away free will also be NFTs. People late to the game or looking to complete sets may want to buy these. You can make some money just by playing the game. 

NFTs will not change anything other than give you the individual full autonomy over the in game items. There is literally no downside, which is why is why Iâ€™m being so vocal.

If Iâ€™m looking at BO1-3 and Cold War, clearly Cold War had the least effort put into it. The BO3 campaign had a lot of depth into it, but it wasnâ€™t obvious; you had to dig deep for it. That was the whole theme of BO3, you really had to be involved in the community and with the game (and all the content released around the game) in order to understand the narrative of campaign and zombies (even MP somewhat). Cold War on the other hand was ankle deep because it had such a short window for development. The campaign was shallow, it didnâ€™t really do too much for the BO storyline other than introduce Bell and Adler, two characters that were never mentioned before that game and are probably going to be disposed of. It was one big side mission to the actual main storyline. And the production quality, while surprisingly good relative to the development timeline Treyarch had, was absolutely not up to par with BO1/2.",1,Butterflychunks,xa029k,0,09-10-2022,9,2022,10,2022,-0.009042708,-1,0,-1,1917,0.0005,0.05

Hans Zimmer composed for a game of a ""military/USA d**kriding"" late/post Bush era with ""heroism"" and lots of setpieces. The same thing as Michael Bay's Transformers gloryfying US grunts. It still sounds good (141 opening riff is goated) but wouldn't work in New MWs (or people would complain about copying Zimmer) 

Sarah Schachner composes in a way with much less grandeur, it's mostly background ambience that is there to enchance the gameplay, not overpower it. It works for a campaign that has very few setpieces, subdued even by OGs standards. It's also different, cause it relies mostly on sharp, sudden strings and bass, elongated droning for a bit of tension/unnerving. [For example this track from MW19 WZ shows that.](https://youtu.be/SapSxRjYcCY)

Youâ€™re no longer in school gaming has changed and so are the way games are made (ie more DLC content and in-game purchases).

The thing that majority of people see can be considered truth.

You can surely say the new map is no longer rusty, the textures are colorful, the chimneys have smoke, the car is Skoda Octavia 2019 clone and not Lada.

From the smokey chimney alone you can judge there are people who supply it with something to burn. The car was recently either bought or washed.

A year later Ghosts comes out. I actually did not have the money to buy it because I'm bad at saving. However I did play it a bunch because my brother bought it. It didn't occur to me to take a selfie with it because it wasn't mine and it wasn't really a ""tradition"" at the time.

Many CoD games with bad or mediocre multiplayers at the very least had either a good campaign or fun as hell co-op mode (yes, specs ops counts, not just zombies). Cold War's campaign is actually a pretty good story with some charm from the characters, and actually has multiple endings, which add replay value. The zombies was so much fun with all the upgradeable perks and pack-a-punch tiers. Or look at Infinite Warfare. That games multiplayer is straight up dogshit with horrible hit detection, latency and lag. But zombies in IW was hella fun (at least, to me). A cool aesthetic to set a zombies map, so many things to do, items to craft. Zombies in space land is one of the best zombie maps imo (the dlc maps were kinda lacklustre though). Then there's the campaign. Had a pretty basic plot that sucked with no villain that had a good or well written motivation, but the characters were so cool and likable (Ethan the robot was such an awesome character, hands down my favourite of that campaign).


But you instead choose to judge these games simply by the MP. That mode only constitutes 1/3 of the game. You miss out on amazing experiences simply because ""multiplayer bad, this game trash lol"".

micro transactions/shit business models thatâ€™s fucked up gaming experiences. Call me old fashioned but I prefer military shooters where weapons are balanced and not nerfed every time a new op weapon comes out to support its â€œseason passâ€ or new version of the game. Where they literally force a single superior play style. They canâ€™t fix glitching menus since the start of warzone and other game bugs, but easily release new store items. Proven to give streamers advantages. Make literal billions while underpaying their non executive employees but they give themselves millions in bonuses. Bring out an anti cheat, that doesnâ€™t work, instead of spending a < 0.1 of their profits on a decent anti cheat software. Used BLM to market themselves on social media.

Have you ever thought about *why* you can't just buy something for a real world price in the store without being worried it'll go away, or buying COD points, or buying the battlepass, etc? It's because they're being manipulative as all hell, even going as far as making new weapons OP so you'd have to buy your way through the battlepass to get them in a timely manner. Only to then nerf them in an update *right* when another OP one comes out. That's changing the experience of the game, literally effecting gameplay. Damn near a hidden p2w mechanic lol

  


Or how about whenever you buy something with COD points you're always having left overs? That's because they want you think you're getting a good deal when you're only a few hundred COD points away from a bundle you like, only to then having to spend way more than it's actually worth on COD points, and once again you have more left over to do it all over again. That's manipulative, you can't deny that.

  


Or how about cosmetics that look so goofy that it completely goes against the artstyle? Because they're willing to kill their artistic integrity to make a quick buck on celebrities, superheroes, etc that don't match the game we're playing. Whether you care or not, that's definitely changing the game experience, especially when some skins just blend in with the environments.

  


Or how about progression? Mainly battlepass progression because it's odd that you can just buy your way through it, right? Well that's on purpose! You see, they artificially make it slower and/or harder to progress through it to get the impatient or lazy or busy to buy their way through it. Simple as that, microtransactions just artificially changed the game experience.

The casuals buy the day 1 Gaz store pack instead of playing for a few days and completing the raid to get it-  the amount of Gaz skin packs I saw the first few days was just... pathetic. I don't care how people spend their money in the end, but I'd be fucking lying if I said I didn't wish I could earn things through actual effort and not just a paycheck. It makes me not even want it when I have to tell someone I paid $30 to get it when they ask how I acquired it. It personally feels cheap.  


I just think it comes down to money, because I've already got 500 hours in the God damn game and I consider myself an avid supporter - but I still haven't even bought the battlepass until the next seasons is about the launch.

Iâ€™ve played every cod since cod4.

Old cods had sbmm.

Which is why devs tell us cod has always had sbmm. Everyone only ever talks about sbmm. This is why the devs get away with it because they just reply with all cods had sbmm when people argue about sbmm in these newer cods.

But what we have now is EOMM. It seems evidently clear hardly anyone knows about it.

Engagement Optimised Match Making.

This is in new cods and thatâ€™s why new cods arenâ€™t fun compared to OG cods.

EOMM has ruined online gaming for the players. But the dev companies love it because it manipulates us into buying more mtx. Not me I wonâ€™t pay more for skins Iâ€™ll level all my guns in multiplayer and grind up to gold camo on a favourite gun. Thatâ€™s all I do cba with paying anything more than base game. Skins just arenâ€™t good value for money.

The health given is perfect. Not every gun is 1 shot, but the guns that should be 1 shot are. The one shot guns have disadvantages as well. Aiming does matter. Attachments actually change the range and feel of guns for advantages to play style. Poor choices are punished, and good shooting is rewarded.

I also don't understand why, but the reduced damage from explosives perk is much better in HC for living explosions than in normal.

There was just enough HUD to be useful UI without the clutter and the health was low enough that it was an even playing field but bad aim combined with poor weapon choice/engagement distance was lethal. Because so many weapons were 1 hit kills if it's a non-penetrative shot within the weapons engagement distance it meant that you could pick just about anything and they were balanced against each other. Weapon choice came down to aesthetic, ROF, recoil, etc. meaning there was rarely a ""meta"" gun. And guns with lower stats in regards to ADS, ROF, mag size, made up for that by having a larger 1 hit kill sweet spot, meaning they could kill from further and being more penetrative. 

30 HP is so little health that it wraps all guns onto the same even playing field, meaning gunfights are determined by skill rather than weapon choice. But it's enough HP that some errors are fatal even if you get the drop on someone. 

It's kind of convoluted but it was balanced. Now with T1 most guns are boarderline unusable because the balancing is horrible for 50 HP. Some guns are one hit kills, some are 2 hit kills, some are 3, and in each of these categories there's one that's a cut above the rest.",15,orphan_clubber,j4wh4jp,1,18-01-2023,1,2023,1,2023,-0.043497744,-1,0,-1,1240,0.0121,1.21

Cold War was overall good also had issues, with meh maps outside of the BO2 remastered maps. Zombies was very good, however.

Vanguard also has issues but imo, the core gameplay was solid (Multiplayer). Zombies was terrible, but Multiplayer (especially Ranked) actually played fairly okay, for players like me who rush a lot.

Is it a â€œCoD cycleâ€? I think thereâ€™s a trend, but not anything to do with this 4Chan-esque armchair psychology that is the cycle. Whatâ€™s the trend? CoD games over the last few years release with a lot of potential, but ultimately are limited in quality/fun due to core design choices that are never addressed and/or bad maps.

Some games cater to some peopleâ€™s playstyles more and they may look past some of the flaws when looking back at the game. Thatâ€™s normal and it happened with every entertainment series that spits out content every year. Personally, I actually liked Vanguard quite a bit - as someone who loves movement heavy CoD games and fast pacing, it ticks off a lot of boxes especially with the Radar and Ninja Perk.",2,TheOriginalTopG,11gyhu3,0,03-04-2023,3,2023,4,2023,0.006267717,1,0,1,1540,0.0013,0.13

When it comes to multiplayer games I genuinely enjoy, that list includes Infinite Warfare, Advanced Warfare, BO2, WWII, and Cold War.  I have my logical opinions on every game.

For the campaigns, the original Modern Warfare trilogy is the best.  World of War is extremely gritty and amazing while Cold War has a lot of good moments.

Vanguard had issues but itâ€™s hyperbole that the game was terrible. Highly flawed?

Every single aspect of Modern Warfare II was designed to empower campers and nerf good players.

You move like a geriatric 70 year old. The movement is the worst in any CoD game.

The ADS times are incredibly slow. The sprint out speeds are slow. Rushers are punished while stationary players are rewarded.

The map design in MWII is garbage. The maps are filled with doors that you can camp behind. There are trash maps like Border Crossing and El Asio.

The gunplay has way too much visual recoil and idle sway making it very difficult to aim precisely and nerfs mouse and keyboard players while buffing aim assist.

The foot steps are incredibly loud. Everyone can hear you approaching from a mile away, further empowering campers and nerfing good players. 

There is endless flash grenade spam which buffs trash players and nerfs good players.

The sound design is awful. The game is nothing but bloated bass and piercing treble. I have headphones far superior to 99.99% of gaming headphones and the game sounds like garbage.


Vanguard is superior to Modern Warfare II. Vanguard actually has a skill gap and doesn't empower garbage players who do nothing but camp and spam flash grenades. 

This is the reason why MWII and Warzone II are dying, no one wants to play this game. No one wants to watch this game, views are in the gutter on YouTube. The gameplay from the best YouTubers all look the same, unimpressive and is boring to watch as there is no movement or aim skill in the game. The skill in this is entirely about positioning which leads to the camping meta.

I really like the new progression and camo system, really like ground war and invasion, really like DMZ, love drill charges... Idk it's just a super fun game for someone like me who is fairly casual but still puts in a lot of time (currently something like level 250).

Yes lack of prestige and slow rate of new map release is a little sucky, but personally once I had enough COD points to get season 2 battle pass for free I just stopped playing until season 2 dropped. 

Would people rather it was like the OG modern warfares where you get new maps but they cost like Â£15 for 3 and everyone is split into different hoppers and if your friend doesn't have the DLC you can't play the DLC maps with them? 

I guess it's different for me because I play games other than COD, but I don't need 5 new maps every 4 weeks and 10 new guns - I play until I'm bored of the current content then hop back on when a new season drops.

Mechanically yes it's really good, Mechanically I'd say it's tied with BO4, they are different though, just the same enjoyment for me. I think Infinite Warfare did BO3 zombies a little better, Burn cards I prefer to gobblegum but other than that they are essentially the same just different maps.

I think BO3 has the worst maps, the only DLC map that isn't chronicles that I enjoyed was zetzebo or however it's spelt. Shadows of Evil is good too, but in a different way that idk how to describe.

I wish BO4 was on Steam so it could've gotten the proper mod attention it deserves but it can be backported anyways. Even though I have chronicles on PC now I haven't really touched it cuz I've had too much fun with custom maps. I couldn't care less about the original maps if it weren't for the workshop support I'd never play BO3 again, I probably would've thought BO4 and bought it for my friends like I did BO3",2,Unlost_maniac,jat4h3f,3,03-03-2023,3,2023,3,2023,0.039426316,1,0,1,1540,0.0013,0.13

I only played a few of the IW maps and they are pretty great. Zombies in Spaceland in my eyes is the single best zombies map ever made and its sad how nobody has remade it in BO3. 

To me AW zombies was pretty good, aside from the Burger Town map, that map was awful. I think BO1, 2 4 and even CW have better maps than BO3. I don't even BO2 zombies was just consistently great all around, although when I was a kid I loved transit and hated die rise now it's the other way around. 

Idk if this makes a difference but I've never really cared about doing the Easter eggs for any zombies map aside from Buried and idk if Origins staffs count or mob pap. I only really play zombies to kill zombies and kill time. Never gotten past round 29 in any map. Although I probably could if I really tried in mob or buried but usual by 25 I get bored and stop playing. I'm very casual with zombies. I wanna give the BO3 maps another shot some day. I've tried to like them but idk. 

AW zombies had some sort of satisfying flow of progression unlike every zombies map except maybe Mob, where I feel like I'm constantly progressing until I'm done. Then I usually close the game",2,Unlost_maniac,jatgs4t,5,03-03-2023,3,2023,3,2023,0.015648521,1,0,1,1540,0.0013,0.13

Lag comp was bad, weapon balance was a mess, and some kill streaks were just unfair for whoever got to them first. Probably more issues than that. I honestly didn't car for the game that much at first. Took me a good 9 months before it really started winning me over.

I was really looking forward to Ghosts, even though I was finally starting to love Bo2. It was looking really good and innovative for CoD. When the YouTubers got to it early, there were red flags, but I generally ignored them because I was hyped for Ghosts. When I finally got my hands on it, I was immediately disappointed at almost every corner. I tried getting through it though. I thought it would be a Bo2 scenario where the game would be patched to perfection. I tried, but couldn't resist the urge to go back to Bo2 every time I had a brain-dead down or blew up from an I.E.D. I went back and just loved Bo2 even more. Hit max prestige for the first time, got cool camos, grinded League Play, and was just loving seeing people's creations with crazy emblems and videos.

One is free to like the game if they wish or play the game however they like but the fact that they like the game is a strong indicator that they're a mediocre player. Again, Infinity Ward developers have repeatedly stated that their games are made for bad players so take it out on the devs if you dislike that others think you're a bad player for praising the game, we're just repeating what the devs said.
