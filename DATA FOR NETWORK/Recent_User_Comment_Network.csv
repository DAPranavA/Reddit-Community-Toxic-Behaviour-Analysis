SadHappyRobotMusic,It's ok to have your own top 5. I agree it creates good discussion.,0.15730999999999998,1
SadHappyRobotMusic,I never take the gas mask. They should make the animation so that you just nod it on and off. Maybe that would be better. Maybe not completely realistic. But probably better.,0.048933333333333336,1

SadHappyRobotMusic,Well technically all matter in the universe is space matter lol,0.1066142857142857,1
SadHappyRobotMusic,Very possible. But I find the idea of this Arabic article about Tutankhamuns gold also being from outer space very appealing lol. Either way the pic is very cool and mysterious imo.,0.035223809523809525,1

SadHappyRobotMusic,"Fantasy is probably the genre I deal with least unfortunatly. But if you could imagine something maybe more quirky I guess I would call it then I make alot of that.

SadHappyRobotMusic,Thanks alot that's some valuable advice that I'll surely think about.,0.15083333333333332,1
SadHappyRobotMusic,"If you dont mind some violence and intense competitive gameplay you guys should play call of duty warzone together. It's free to play and very tactical and intense. You can be up to 4 players in a squad and you compete against about 200 other players that are in teams together. It's fun, but can be pretty hard also. That's my suggestion. You can play it on xbox one, ps4, ps5 and PC and the new xbox (I cant even recall the xbox names nowadays lol) And theres crossplay so you can play across all those platforms for example someone you meet could be playing on pc while your son is on ps4 and you on xbox.

Even ""non-mystery"" Marvel products have had significant plot twists - Obadiah being revealed as the one who hired the Ten Rings, Hela revealing Odin's darker past by blasting away the ceiling relief, the Ancient One using the dark dimension... Some of these were telegraphed and foreshadowed, but at least there were twists.  But with SI it's like they didn't trust the audience to follow \*at all\*.

But SI would basically just begin a scene by \*showing\* you that the people were skrulls.   Rather than having us wonder how deep the inflitration was, they just showed us a roundtable of all the skrull world leaders.  Rather than having us guess whether Rhodey, Priscilla, etc were skrulls and keep us on our toes, they just told us early on.  In a shape-shifting show about people who can change faces, rather than having us try to figure out \*who\* killed Maria Hill, and making everyone dangerous, they identified the villain in the first episode.

I have to wonder if at one point, it was a more mysterious show, and they re-edited sections to give away reveals so the audience wouldn't get ""confused."" The one thing I did end up liking is that I was expecting a complete resolution at the end, with Ritson offering citizenship to the skrulls for saving his life. I really liked the big reveal at the end that there are so many more pods, and I am now wondering if Ritson himself is a skrull tyring to clean up Gravik's mess by taking out the obvious operatives.  If that's the case, then it's almost like the show was a setup for a much larger story.  There are a million skrulls still out there, after all.

bonemech_meatsuit,"I feel like this show exemplified that Fury works better as a small side part rather than a lead.  I'm intrigued when we see *less* of him bc it seems like he's up to something. His marriage in particular has been very hard for me to digest. I'm not wild about the idea that fury had a happy domestic side with a pretentious alien freedom fighter, and the show has kept giving us whiplash as to whether she hates him enough to kill him, or loves him more than anything.

But now we know too much about him. Without the rest of the avengers to bounce off of, he loses a lot of his momentum.

I feel like there was an opportunity here for a shadow stalking, slow revealing conspiracy. But they tanked every plot twist and mystery early on in the show - the wife being a skrull, gravik being the one who shot maria, the dialogue reveal from Talos that there are a million skrulls on earth, the roundtable scene with gravik where we learn that several major world leaders are skrulls (and it never affects anything again)

Worse, is I don't see how this plot wraps up without it simply being a slugfest to kill Gravik, and then all the skrulls that had been willing to commit global genocide will just be like ""oh cool"" and go back to normal life.

These are all very deliberate choices the filmmakers made, to have the story play out like a melodrama more than a mystery thriller (why is beyond me) but I do hope that the conclusion is at least somewhat satisfying.",0.01683586206896552,1

1. Messi

2. Pele

3. Maradona

4. CR7 

Those four are untouchable and even a lot of rankings online seem to agree. Maybe CR7 edges Maradona, itâ€™s debatable. 

Beyond that itâ€™s difficult to get a general consensus. Mine would be:

It doesnâ€™t make you a step above the rest of community when it comes to this subject.

Iâ€™m not blaming you for thinking that sbmm doesnâ€™t exist, but itâ€™s extremely likely that you are not good enough to experience the harsh nature of sbmm.

As far I have heard having something which has a face in someone's house is totally prohibited but it is totally permitted if it is for a child.

Or to draw the body of a human being without defining features of a human such as eyes, Nose, ears etc.

Based on this stuff toy, I am doubtful because it doesn't completely represent a living creature. It doesn't have a nose just like the emojis. But in my opinion it is best to give it away to a child.

Break the problem into pieces. For an FPS you need: player controller, shooting, enemy AI, saveload, Menu UI. Then you search for individual features and follow on micro-scale. If the tutorial does not fit you, you just find another one.

They work insane hours and want to literally break out of the workaholic lifestyle, but they don't have a choice. So I think that's what made the game appealing to them.

The idea for the game actually came to me back in 2019 when I was working in a concrete building, in an office. I wanted to break the pillars, I was angry and feeling stuck. Backrooms just happened to be the ideal base for this feeling. And some people resonate with that it seems.

A word of advice--do not fight the boss on the bridge until you found an angelic statue somewhere in the bottom of the map.  Once you receive a certain item from that said statue, then proceed on the bridge and you'll get a different cutscene for the boss fight.

Another portion of the quest involves receiving a key above where you first started (through a pair of doors) and completing a small side quest for the librarian holding the keys.  Once you give him the key, he'll lead you to another NPC.  After that, you just have to defeat the two additional bosses and acquire Gold eyes.

There is nothing official to substantiate anything because word of mouth and popular belief isn't cold hard facts.

If something had been an issue, it would have been officially been broadcasted by official sources from the developers.  And no, addressing malicious reports is not proof of mass reporting to cause shadow bans.  If it had been, it would have been addressed publicly.

If mass reporting caused people to get kicked out, wouldn't you think that the problem would be more widespread?  I play all the time and I never get kicked out nor have I been regular banned or shadow banned whatsoever. Why is that specific people seem to be claiming this to be an issue, especially when they are popular enough to get hundreds of thousands of people to believe them?

As of now, the punishments are justified.  If people disagree, then they should stop using a variety of programs and tactics that places them in shadow ban lobbies, such as VPNs, Cronus, unlock tools, in-game behavior (reverse boosting), etc.",-0.02459770992366412,-1

When you talk about the boot camp game mode, it's not going to work. It's not popular enough and it wastes playlist space. If there had to be any kind of boot camp, it would just be an offline mode with only bots that gives you tips on what to do in certain situations.

The reason why persistent lobbies are gone is because the search times suffered. With too many people staying in the lobbies, the searching player pool was nearly dried up.  Nowadays, it's much easier to find matches and people can no longer establish boosting lobbies like they used to.

A year later, she somehow hacked into every single one of my social medias (I mean literally everything, she even changed my xbox username and was using my tinder). Still to this day Iâ€™m finding little easter eggs that she left me, such as this bio in my workways profile. She committed suicide last year and I feel terrible about it, but there was no doubt that meth unfortunately took over her life. It definitely taught me to never fuck with it.

Movement: Boots on the ground and fast paced. Bring back side dashing from AW but just have it so the operator does a quick strafe from side to side (rather than using a jetpack for it)

Perks: Ghostsâ€™ perk system was underrated imo, Iâ€™d welcome that back

TTK: Cold War. Perfect time to react to enemies

Prestige system: Classic like the older CoDs, but with more rewards. Instead of just getting a calling card + permanent unlock every prestige, reward us with some nice blueprints or operator skins
