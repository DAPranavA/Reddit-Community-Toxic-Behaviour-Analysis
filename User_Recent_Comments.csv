You can be up to 4 players in a squad and you compete against about 200 other players that are in teams together. It's fun, but can be pretty hard also. That's my suggestion. You can play it on xbox one, ps4, ps5 and PC and the new xbox (I cant even recall the xbox names nowadays lol) And theres crossplay so you can play across all those platforms for example someone you meet could be playing on pc while your son is on ps4 and you on xbox.

I would know this because my very first character was a Chaotic Neutral Kenku Artificer named Tink and HOLY HELL did I have a ROUGH time learning the system, but after a couple of months, I started to slowly understand it, and oh my god that was so rewarding.  


For baby's first characters, I'd probably ask them what kind of combat playstyle they want, suggest a class for them based on that, then help the player's make their characters from there. That's part of how I got someone to understand character creation in like 5 minutes due to them wanting a melee healer playstyle, therefore I helped them build a paladin.  


Also you're players are gonna be confused regardless of in game tutorials, so I'd recommend they watch [Jocat's ""Crap Guide To DND"" Series](https://youtu.be/00EvO-X6Wu4) if you're playing 5E since all of those videos are short and they're also funny enough to be remembered, which helps a LOT with remembering stuff, believe me. You could also try to introduce them to live shows like [Critical Role](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL1tiwbzkOjQxD0jjAE7PsWoaCrs0EkBH2) or Dimension 20 to give them an idea of how some people play the game, but remind them that those guys are experienced actors and your players should not try to copy them. The cast of Critical Role even said so themselves at one point. Pretty sure Matt Mercer and the rest of Critical Role has gotten REAL sick of hearing horror stories about how people tried to replicate their style and failing.  


Thanks to my friend Gary recommending those Crap Guide videos to me when I first started, I understand the system a lot better now. It was certainly better than being confused about everything no matter how hard people try to explain it and going ""HOW DOES THIS WORK?"" every time DND is mentioned.  


As far as races go, I'd allow everything in the PHB and DMG as well as Goblins, Aarakocra (you can replace this with Owlins from the strixhaven book if you're afraid of the party getting jealous of fly speed), Genasi, Changelings, and Kobolds.  


If you REALLY wanna make a good first impression of the game to your players, play some music in the background and describe the first town they walk into in detail. [I made a really good playlist for songs you could play in the background while DMing (what a shocker, its filled with mostly Xenoblade music because those soundtracks are BANGERS and fit DND really well in my opinion)](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLUxwIm-ckvmd1bvpye4Y1dylrnkUnCzGA)  


For PC backgrounds, I think you're pretty safe with allowing anything because backgrounds allow for an intense amount of character roleplay and creativity when making your character. I'd allow custom backgrounds in case their background feature doesn't match their character at all.  


I'd also let players base their characters off of characters they already know because it helps them get used to roleplaying. I based part of my first character on Handsome Jack from the Borderlands series, for example.  


I'd also introduce your PCs to the world with a city they're all going to arrive in for a reason related to their backstory and background.  Maybe one of your PCs is like Rex from the game Xenoblade Chronicles 2 where they find a treasure worth enough gold to feed them for the next few days, then go to sell it at an Adventurer's Guild and get called up to the Chairman's office with a job offer worth 10,000 gold, where they meet the rest of the party when they immediately accept.   


It's relevant to Rex as a character because it starts with him doing his usual profession of turning junk metal from the sea into something that people can use in their everyday lives, which then slowly gets him involved in the story because the Chairman's job involves digging up treasure from the sea, that treasure ending up being something that would change his life forever.

&#x200B;

Or maybe a PC is more like Luke Skywalker from Star Wars, who started as a bored farm boy who simply wants to go out and make a difference in the world.

YlpeaNyyppa,"Sales don't really mean much. Especially when you're one of the most recognisable characters in human history with over ten blockbuster movies made about you recently with one of the most successful video games under Sony's belt and you're merchandised to all hell. Of course Spider-Man is one of the best sellers. As always sales don't say anything about quality. Otherwise Big Bang Theory would be the height of Television or Suicide Squad (the shitty one) would be a great movie. Simpsons are still doing numbers while Andor is failing. Numbers are to be taken with some salt on the side. Getting shitted on for 13 years straight I'd argue says more about Spider-Man. Especially when other Spider-works are getting so much praise.

I personally critised JMS back then and at least what I had a problem with and what others I talked to as well was the fantasy aspect. Gods, ghosts, prophecies and zombies. Peter and MJ themselves were at their best here. JMS was considered (by some) to have had awful additions to the lore that destroy some of the most interesting and relatable parts of the character which is fair. People reminicsing how MJ was an actual 3 dimensional character treated well just kind of happens to be the thing on people's minds because of the more recent what sometimes is called character assassination of MJ (and sometimes Peter.) JMS is still quite controversial but the good is just the thing that gets brought up due to context.

Slott  gets too much hate because his run was basically the next one after OMD so he got the role of being the representation of the New Spider-Man which people hate. While he had some good stuff his run is tainted because of OMD for people. You read a story you like and Charlie pops up. Every time he tries to do something with Aunt May it only ends up highlighting how worthless the character really is. Here's Peter struggling with things he kind of got past with previous runs. Sucks for him but it's what it is. His run did have some good stuff but also some very bad stuff which combined with OMD leads to a lot of hatred. I agree it's overblown but I don't think it's really that unreasonable. I think if the editorial didn't have stupid ideas Slott might've been much more popular amongst the fans. He just kind of got stuck with the bad editorial. The hatred is still very consistent on why it exists.

&#x200B;

>especially while continuing to support a book they say they canâ€™t stand

If you support the book and you're dismissed because ""you still bought it."" Pirate it and it's ""why should anyone listen to you, you're not buying the book."" Don't read and now you can't have an opinion.

I do think a lot of nuance is lost in these conversations but I do think it comes from a very honest place and with Wells' run it's kind of just culmination of a very long line of frustrations. Getting ignored sucks and seeing your favorite character be mistreated is heartbreaking which is why it gets a little out of hand. It's still very honest critisism and I think very correct too.",-0.00022250803858520914,-1
YlpeaNyyppa,"The point is that things have been wrong at least ever since Sins Past so 20 years literally is correct. Then 90's was it's own special clusterfuck with Clone Saga so 30 years is even more correct. Now is that fans being unreasonable or Spider-Man book going wrong and staying on the wrong path for a long time? Like we don't want to complain. Spidey team just keeps on undoing iconic storylines, mistreating characters and fundamentally misunderstanding Spider-Man's appeal. 

Everyone complains about the main book but then you look around and the same fans love Insomniac's take and they love Life Story and Ultimate and praised Spencer for like a year. The points made now are the same ones as 20 years ago. You shouldn't undo iconic deaths for cheap shock value. OMD sucks. Please stop writing almost 30-year-old man like he's 20. Treat MJ with respect. Other media and alternative comics fix all these issues and people love them for it.

YlpeaNyyppa,"N'Sane trilogy treatment would be best. Remake the original 3 as loyally as possible with modern improvements like non-inverted camera, wide screen, infinite lives, modern graphics, skip dialogue options and all that jazz. The PS2 versions can't realistically be ported without issues (as seen with PS3 ports) and even then you're limited in what you can do. Many of these improvement are very much needed, especially for new comers who've never experienced the dark ages of gaming. The core story and gameplay are strong enough that with just improved visuals and accessibility options and with a little help from nostalgia marketing you could have a little hit in your hands.

4 is bigger then all other 3 combined so it probably wouldn't be feasible to include in the collection but if the collection's successful enough you could add the fourth game in later and then you could smoothly continue from a cliffhanger with Sly 5 or a little DLC. Right now a cliffhanger is kind of an issue for Sly 5 since most people wouldn't have played Sly 4 or probably don't remember it. This would solve that issue and as a bonus the series would be much easier to port over to any future consoles compared to the PS2 and PS3 versions providing long term benefit.",0.055558955223880595,1

bonemech_meatsuit,"It's really wild. Even ""non-mystery"" Marvel products have had significant plot twists - Obadiah being revealed as the one who hired the Ten Rings, Hela revealing Odin's darker past by blasting away the ceiling relief, the Ancient One using the dark dimension... Some of these were telegraphed and foreshadowed, but at least there were twists.  But with SI it's like they didn't trust the audience to follow \*at all\*.

But SI would basically just begin a scene by \*showing\* you that the people were skrulls.   Rather than having us wonder how deep the inflitration was, they just showed us a roundtable of all the skrull world leaders.  Rather than having us guess whether Rhodey, Priscilla, etc were skrulls and keep us on our toes, they just told us early on.  In a shape-shifting show about people who can change faces, rather than having us try to figure out \*who\* killed Maria Hill, and making everyone dangerous, they identified the villain in the first episode.

I have to wonder if at one point, it was a more mysterious show, and they re-edited sections to give away reveals so the audience wouldn't get ""confused."" The one thing I did end up liking is that I was expecting a complete resolution at the end, with Ritson offering citizenship to the skrulls for saving his life. I really liked the big reveal at the end that there are so many more pods, and I am now wondering if Ritson himself is a skrull tyring to clean up Gravik's mess by taking out the obvious operatives.  If that's the case, then it's almost like the show was a setup for a much larger story.  There are a million skrulls still out there, after all.  But I'm prepared to be disappointed.",0.005164245810055866,1

bonemech_meatsuit,"I feel like this show exemplified that Fury works better as a small side part rather than a lead.  I'm intrigued when we see *less* of him bc it seems like he's up to something. His marriage in particular has been very hard for me to digest. I'm not wild about the idea that fury had a happy domestic side with a pretentious alien freedom fighter, and the show has kept giving us whiplash as to whether she hates him enough to kill him, or loves him more than anything.

But now we know too much about him. Without the rest of the avengers to bounce off of, he loses a lot of his momentum.

I feel like there was an opportunity here for a shadow stalking, slow revealing conspiracy. But they tanked every plot twist and mystery early on in the show - the wife being a skrull, gravik being the one who shot maria, the dialogue reveal from Talos that there are a million skrulls on earth, the roundtable scene with gravik where we learn that several major world leaders are skrulls (and it never affects anything again)

Worse, is I don't see how this plot wraps up without it simply being a slugfest to kill Gravik, and then all the skrulls that had been willing to commit global genocide will just be like ""oh cool"" and go back to normal life.

These are all very deliberate choices the filmmakers made, to have the story play out like a melodrama more than a mystery thriller (why is beyond me) but I do hope that the conclusion is at least somewhat satisfying.",0.01683586206896552,1

The fact that you're thinking it's actually Atwell in that moment and that they forgot to change \*her\* eye color to blue only emphasizes how convincing and well-done that scene was.  If your criticism is that the IMF team forgot to change her eyes, their machine broke.

realsouville,"An example for poor line delivery: In the apartment scene if you listen to the difference in inflection between the game scene and tv scene, she sounds imo more aggressive and bratty in the tv scene compared to the sort of succumbed curiosity in the game.

In the game he sounds tired and worn, whereas in the tv series he sounds angry and easily provoked (again demonstrated later in the guard outside the walls scene. again, I think they messed this up as it connects ellie to his daughter too quickly rather than that being something thats built up slowly like in the game)

about the random scenes, you have a point. I just feel like while they donâ€™t really take away anything they just donâ€™t add too much (which is fine obviously they need content to fill the series). ig theyâ€™re chill

The way I see it, ROTF amplified everything in 2007, both the good and the bad. And Bay himself said he went too far with the humor, so he used that feedback to make DOTM better. Also, the ramifications of Prime's conversation with Galloway are explored in both films, a neat detail often overlooked (TL;DR ROTF and DOTM examine the implications of the Autobots' presence on Earth and the transformer/human relationship).

I defend the first 3. Fuck AOE and TLK though, those movies shouldn't have been made. I bet people would think better of Bayverse had it stopped at 3.

* While Thor is Odin's son, he's not related to Loki, Hela (originally just Hel, which is confusing because the underworld is also just called Hel, but it is sometimes referred to as Helheim, so that's helpful) or Frigga (originally just Frigg). His mother is Fjorgyn, the personification of the earth, and while he has many brothers, including Baldr and Hodr, Loki isn't one of them, instead being a blood brother of Odin. Finally, Hel is Loki's daughter, not her brother.
* Loki is also married and has another four kids-two sons by his wife Sigyn, Nari and Vali, and two by the jotunn Angrboda, Fenrir and Jormungandr. Hel is the daughter of Angrboda.
* Thor has a stepson, Ullr, and two sons, Magni and Modi. In fact, after Ragnarok, during which he's supposed to kill Jormungandr, take nine steps (yes, precisely nine, Idk why), and drop dead, and in the post-Ragnarok world, his sons will wield Mjolnir.

1. Messi

2. Pele

4. CR7 

Those four are untouchable and even a lot of rankings online seem to agree. Maybe CR7 edges Maradona, itâ€™s debatable. 

Beyond that itâ€™s difficult to get a general consensus. Mine would be:

Unfortunately you, being a player â€œsince mw2â€ doesnâ€™t mean shit as I see countless people who think that means anything in this argument. It doesnâ€™t make you a step above the rest of community when it comes to this subject. Hereâ€™s the thing: we donâ€™t REALLY know what sbmm really takes into factor, or why itâ€™s even there; we only know that if you do better in lobbies, youâ€™re gonna get harder ones after and vice versa.

Iâ€™m not blaming you for thinking that sbmm doesnâ€™t exist, but itâ€™s extremely likely that you are not good enough to experience the harsh nature of sbmm. Iâ€™m not even proclaiming myself as some god amongst men when it comes to COD, iâ€™d say im a B tier player.

take a look at pro players, they already despise this game. not because â€œitâ€™s not that same as the last one,â€ but because it has so many unnecessary features for realism purposes: no reload cancellation, high muzzle flash, high sprint to fire times, no name plates (i bet you love that feature), no red dots on mini map, and i can go on and on and on. please, just play cold war or some other cod and see how many kills you can get. on MWII the most kills iâ€™ve ever seen on a DOM match was 46, extremely saddening",-0.03401038961038961,-1

As far I have heard having something which has a face in someone's house is totally prohibited but it is totally permitted if it is for a child. It is also permissible if the stuff toy is missing features which usually defines living creatures this is the main reason scholars say it is permissible to use emojis. Or to draw the body of a human being without defining features of a human such as eyes, Nose, ears etc.

Based on this stuff toy, I am doubtful because it doesn't completely represent a living creature. It doesn't have a nose just like the emojis. But in my opinion it is best to give it away to a child. As the hadeeth which  was narrated by at-Tirmidhi (2442), Ahmad (1630) and Ibn Hibbaan (722) from al-Hasan ibn â€˜Ali (may Allah be pleased with him) who said: I memorized from the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him): â€œLeave that which makes you doubt for that which does not make you doubt, for truth leads to reassurance and lies lead to uncertainty.â€ Classed as saheeh by Shaykh al-Albaani (may Allah have mercy on him).",0.018593965517241382,1

Feel free to vote based on how hot you think the sprite is, maybe a specific role they play in a particular story, or something else entirely.

They work insane hours and want to literally break out of the workaholic lifestyle, but they don't have a choice. So I think that's what made the game appealing to them.

The idea for the game actually came to me back in 2019 when I was working in a concrete building, in an office. I wanted to break the pillars, I was angry and feeling stuck. Backrooms just happened to be the ideal base for this feeling. And some people resonate with that it seems.

Strifibox,"The Canadian Leopard 1 C2A1 MEXAS tank is a formidable vehicle that has played a significant role in Canadian military operations. The Leopard 1 was originally designed in the 1960s as a main battle tank for the German military. However, the Canadian Forces acquired the vehicle in the 1970s and have since upgraded it with the MEXAS (MEtallic eXplosive Reactive Armour System) package to enhance its effectiveness on the battlefield.  
  
The Leopard 1 C2A1 MEXAS tank is a key element in Canadian armoured regiments and has been utilized in various missions, including Operation Athena in Afghanistan. The vehicle was sent to Afghanistan in 2002 as part of the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) and was used to support Canadian troops in their efforts to bring stability to the country.  
  
The Leopard 1 C2A1 MEXAS tank was a critical asset for the Canadian Forces during Operation Athena. Its advanced armour system, firepower, and mobility were essential in providing cover for ground troops and supporting their efforts to eliminate Taliban insurgents. The vehicle's MEXAS armour system, which uses reactive plates to deflect and absorb the impact of incoming projectiles, proved to be an invaluable asset in the dangerous and hostile terrain of Afghanistan.  
  
One of the most significant engagements involving the Leopard 1 C2A1 MEXAS tank in Afghanistan was during the Battle of Panjwaii in 2006. Canadian forces were engaged in a fierce battle with Taliban insurgents in the village of Pashmul, and the Leopard 1 played a crucial role in providing cover and suppressing enemy fire. The vehicle's 105mm cannon was used to destroy enemy positions and structures, while its armour allowed it to withstand attacks and provide cover for infantry.  
  
Another critical operation that utilized the Leopard 1 C2A1 MEXAS tank was during the Kandahar Offensive in 2010. Canadian forces launched a major operation to clear Taliban strongholds in the province of Kandahar, and the Leopard 1 provided much-needed fire support to ground troops. The vehicle's mobility allowed it to quickly move across the rugged terrain of southern Afghanistan and engage enemy positions with its powerful cannon.  
  
Overall, the Canadian Leopard 1 C2A1 MEXAS tank has proven to be a vital asset to Canadian forces in Afghanistan. Its advanced armour, firepower, and mobility have allowed it to provide critical support to ground troops and play a key role in defeating Taliban insurgents. The vehicle's success in Afghanistan has highlighted its effectiveness in modern warfare, and it continues to be a vital component of the Canadian armoured corps today.",0.006473529411764704,1

It was meant to use a skin with art on it to debrand the phones. Which eventually went to tablets, Consoles eventually laptops. Hence the name Dbrand. What the twist is people **want** to show their apple and triple headed snake backlighted logos.

I have fixed the problem, I switched the Proton version to Proton 3.7-8. After this Call of The Dead stopped frame dropping. 

However after switching to Proton 3.7-8 every time I aimed in everything went blurry. To fix this I went to the Local Game Files in the desktop mode of Black Ops 1. Call of duty Black Ops > players > config.cfg. Opened it and looked for r_dof_enabled 1. Replaced the 1 with a 0 (so r_dof_enabled 0) and saved the file.

This fixed it for me and now I am finally able to play Call of The Dead on my Steamdeck without any framedrops.

Another portion of the quest involves receiving a key above where you first started (through a pair of doors) and completing a small side quest for the librarian holding the keys.

If something had been an issue, it would have been officially been broadcasted by official sources from the developers.  And no, addressing malicious reports is not proof of mass reporting to cause shadow bans.  If it had been, it would have been addressed publicly.

If mass reporting caused people to get kicked out, wouldn't you think that the problem would be more widespread?  I play all the time and I never get kicked out nor have I been regular banned or shadow banned whatsoever. Why is that specific people seem to be claiming this to be an issue, especially when they are popular enough to get hundreds of thousands of people to believe them?

The reason why persistent lobbies are gone is because the search times suffered. With too many people staying in the lobbies, the searching player pool was nearly dried up.

Look at the shift in quality of any game from 2k, the focus on only GTA online and the abandonment of RDR2 online after it showed bad signs of profits.

RadBrad4333,"Really appreciate that perspective! 

For me, thereâ€™s a lot of reasons why this seems to be a very bad move,

1. Microsoft long term goals: with this lawsuit, a lot of internal documents have come out (Iâ€™ll Goto my Twitter bookmarks for sauce) but a lot of speculation on Xboxâ€™s long term game plan have been confirmed. Xbox wants the gaming space to be digital as possible at seemingly all costs. Games wonâ€™t be downloaded cause theyâ€™re on the cloud. You wonâ€™t need to own your games because theyâ€™re on gamepass, etc etc. 

Now that isnâ€™t bad on it own, but consider how the streaming market went. When Netflix became the shit, it leveraged itself until it was more connivence for other companies to make their own services. Royalties add up so some movies are deleted off platforms forever. Streaming is infamous for being a net loss business model for movies, how is that sustainable for AAA games ALSO in the $100-$200 mark? Itâ€™s not.

2. A lot of people think this is just giving Xbox the sword PlayStation already has, itâ€™s not.

PlayStation has a lot of exclusives that are also really fucking good. I wish the conversation around this whole thing turned into more of a look into exclusivity and what okay and whatâ€™s not but thatâ€™s for a different post. 

Point being aside from 2 studios, SONY doesnâ€™t own the studios it gets exclusivity with. Per the court documents and both Xbox and PlayStations own acknowledgment, SONY was simply ready to pay more for the exclusivity deals (something incredible ironic given Xboxâ€™s â€œweâ€™ll just outspend themâ€ idea). We shouldnâ€™t reward Xbox because they didnâ€™t play ball. 

Thereâ€™s OF COURSE the argument that SONY is also leveraging its audience size to get those deals but even then, that was at a time when Xbox didnâ€™t have such a small market share and pay to could make deals. 

We shouldnâ€™t be creating monopolies to fight monopolies, we should be looking at SONY.",0.003235078534031413,1

RadBrad4333,"Redfall is a game that was mess that only because in 2018 Zenimax told Bethesda to pump out as many live service, f2p experiences as possible in order to look like a money printer to potential buyers, I wonder who bought them and didnâ€™t give any guidance after the fact? In Phil Spencerâ€™s words â€œwe did a bad job engaging with Arkane Bethesda early onâ€

343 is just Xbox under a different name and they have somehow ran a franchise the size of Zelda into the ground in a decade through nothing but mismanagement and short sighted greed. Halo was a game that SOLD Xboxâ€™s that Microsoft was interested in fostering. Infinite was almost 8 years in the making because itâ€™s supposed to be the next 10 years of halo, thereâ€™s no â€œnext oneâ€ anytime than closer fallout 5 

Look at the Xbone, announced with â€œno disc trayâ€ and you see where Microsoftâ€™s new focus on cloud gaming is going. The Xbone flopped and led to the insane difference in market share we see today. 

Again in Philâ€™s own words, they lost the console war but while heâ€™s trying to use that as a reason to be rewarded, I say fuck em.

Starry402,It would of been really cool if CW zombies had a actual strike team cast crew for the mode,0.01585,1
Starry402,"1. I should of been more clear, I will not count waw because of its technology limits and the overall time it was released. 

2. I would say the same for zombies because most of time, you get to around round 30 and then give up which can make it boring, however the MP I just kind of stop playing after 2 matches because most of the maps have a large design and donâ€™t flow well. They arenâ€™t bad by any means, just way too big to find enemies quickly. The weapons have crap damage and only 5 weapons are actually good

3. Glad you agree with me, so much people excuse mw2 with this piss poor balancing it had. But when a new game has poor balancing itâ€™s deemed terrible.

4. Again I should be more specific. The pick 10 system was great at first, but the more games it was added it became slowly overused and predictable. I mean hell even with 2 attachments a weapon became super OP. Compared to 5 or 10 attachments. LSAT target finder and long range made the weapon super op to the point it had no counters. Scar-H suppressor and long range. While yes it probably has better balancing than the gunsmith, it was extremely unbalanced for its game. Brecci with long range and rapid fire made every weapon against it useless. Which is why the gunsmith for me is superior because even with 5-10 attachments you can have counters.

5. Again, this is why I said itâ€™s not as great. Because even in Cold War which was hated for its prestige system, you could still brag about getting past level 200. Even if it was for bragging, I could have 1200 hours into bo3 and still be level 55. Even if I get a emblem, it isnâ€™t comparable to Cold War where you could get weapon blueprints and cool calling cards/emblems every 50 levels. 

6. I just recently got back in ww2 and I think itâ€™s maybe top 8? But cold I consider to be a great cod. It did what every past 7 cods did but far better in terms of gameplay and monetization. I would honestly say itâ€™s the closet to a bo2 or a bo1 remaster. 

7. Again I need to be more specific, it was very balanced yes. But it doesnâ€™t excuse that the devs blatantly took sounds and animations from mw2 and just put it on mw3, and then having a identical UI. It pretty much got the VG treatment. SHG took animations and sounds from ww2 and put it on here.

8. Itâ€™s more than doors and sbmm, many features werenâ€™t needed and just ruined the game. Camping felt like the only viable play style. It has great visuals and animations but doesnâ€™t excuse its piss poor gameplay.

9. I honestly never saw people play OBJ in scorestreak related games and saw more people doing OBJ in killstreak games. Which is kind of weird. I think itâ€™s because most people will get kills going for the obj.",0.004885389610389611,1
Starry402,Most cod zombies YouTubers try to overextend information by making 2 minutes worth of info into 10 minutes. The meme is Eren Yeager from AOT saying â€œNo! I donâ€™t want that!â€,0.01214,1
Starry402,"1. Again, I didnâ€™t compare the future titles, I just said if there was a authentic cod for a ww2 cod, it would be boring.

2. You assumed that I was talking about the future titles, I only said bo1 is the most boring cod to exist. So again you assumed.

3. Every cod has the same gameplay, shoot enemies, call streak, play objective or get kills and win. Itâ€™s been like that since 2007 or early on. So I donâ€™t know why you keep saying this.

4. Again, you keep ignoring what Iâ€™m saying. Oh hey the scar-h using the suppressor and long barrel. Shits OP. With vanguard I could simply use a suppressor and a VDD 760 which is a long barrel. And have the same effect. The pick 10 system was severely limited you, like hey I want to do a secondary, to bad you canâ€™t use one. Even with 2 attachments you could drastically change a gun. L-SAT? Remember that? Remember if you used the target finder and long barrel, shit was so unbalanced and broken? Even with 5-10 attachments, the gun can still act better in a balanced way.

5. Again this doesnâ€™t make sense, I could still stay on level 55 for the entire games life cycle, and with the newer games itâ€™s still the same. The cosmetics arenâ€™t p2w, weapons are unlockable, and after level 55 you have everything unlocked. With the prestige keys you get every 50 levels you could unlock actual weapon blueprints if you donâ€™t have a weapon leveled up, and could choose your own calling card or emblem. Oh hey look the old games just rested you, but you donâ€™t get any rewards at all but just get a new prestige icon. How rewarding is that? There was nothing rewarding when you prestiged, I donâ€™t get why people still like this system when again, you donâ€™t get anything. Staying on level 55 is the exact same as level 200.

6. Again, you saw, but didnâ€™t play. Again I can fairly tell youâ€™re new, because the long time fans didnâ€™t even give a shit about cold wars movement, CW movement is pretty fast and the game itself is fast paced. Itâ€™s the closet thing to a bo2/bo1 remaster if weâ€™re being honest. Yeah, sbmm was a thing. But thatâ€™s probably the only actual problem with the game, snipers are OP yes, but if you can actually move instead of running in a straight direction you can actually counter them. And again you said you stopped playing after bo4, so whatever youâ€™re saying canâ€™t be valid because youâ€™re assuming or listening to someone. Play the damn thing and get the experience then talk. Iâ€™ve been playing Cold War for a straight up year and half, since day 1 and I have had no problem with the movement or SBMM at all. And I have a 1.80 K/D.

7. Not at all, MW2 in its prime was hated. Balancing issues, bugs. Hell the official forum was so bashed with people trashing on the game. People just get blinded or because the new games are getting worse, when in reality the game, was a mess. By your logic, if Iâ€™m dying to a whitley and piercing vision and shotguns 24/7 thatâ€™s fun and love dying to them. No one is gonna fucking like it dying by the akimbo rangers, commando pro, and other abominations the game had.",-0.0051752136752136755,-1
Starry402,"1. I only talked about a more authentic ww2 cod, not every cod after 2015

2. Where did I compare bo1 to any cod in that sentence, tell me. Bo1 only had like 5 actual good weapons and the rest were terrible or underpowered. I still consider bo1 to be boring in terms of mw2 and bo2.

3. Iâ€™m literally talking about the gameplay, and not the community, I could give less of a shit about someone death threatening someone else. Stop fucking ignoring that

4. You had bo2, aw, bo3, iw, and bo4 have that system, thatâ€™s 5 games with the exact same system. Thatâ€™s overused. And tell me whatâ€™s balanced when everyone was using a brecci with extended barrel, fast mags, and rapid fire. Or using  the same generic perks. 

5. So by that logic, the Cold War perk system is fantastic because I reached level 200+ on every season because I reached it? â€œAggregious amount of hoursâ€ the old prestige system could take you 2 and a half weeks of leveling if you werenâ€™t addicted and playing it 24/7 did you even play the games?

6.Boohoo Cold War didnâ€™t feel slow or sluggish moving on.

7. Yeah, totally a lot of passion! The developers recycling the same weapons and menu design for a game they made 2 years later is alot of passion. Whereâ€™s fucking passion when youâ€™re shamelessly ripping off reload animations, weapons, menu design from a previous game you worked on. Gtfo.

unconventional_gamer,"I spent the year playing this on Xbox instead of Vanguard when that came out. Got exclusion zone and got to prestige 6. It was a great time.

Lobbies are still there, only TDM though. Maybe if youâ€™re lucky youâ€™ll manage to get DOM but itâ€™s not even worth the hassle waiting for the perfect moment.

Hardcore TDM is also still playable but itâ€™s only ever 1 lobby and can immediately be ruined by a few people who dedicate their lives to trolling in hardcore by spamming their team with flashes. If they get kicked they can just rejoin straight away since itâ€™s the only lobby in hardcore. These people genuinely blow my mind and Iâ€™m not exaggerating when I say they dedicate their lives to it. You will remember their names and I saw the same people doing it the whole year I played it

Core is fine though as long as you play at peak hours (weekends usually any time, weekday evenings)

Joan is Awful: awful episode, even if it wasnâ€™t black mirror

Loch Henry: banger, great twist and unpredictable

Space one forgot the name: solid but predictable. Still up there

Mazey Day: fuck off. Decent if void of context and ignore all the poor writing and conveniences for the protagonist. Bad by black mirror standards 

Still yet to see the Demon something episode or whatever itâ€™s to called, although Iâ€™ve heard people brand it with â€œRed Mirrorâ€ which doesnâ€™t spell hope for me. Weâ€™ll see though. Either way, still a better season than s5, but very much slipping away from what the show actually is",-0.016638028169014087,-1

unconventional_gamer,"I kept pausing the episode at points just trying to understand wtf I was watching and why any of it even makes sense (it doesnâ€™t btw)

I just finished my degree in computer science and, whilst Iâ€™m not an expert I still understand this shit, I kept finding myself absolutely baffled at the rules they were setting up in this universe. Black mirror has always been a bit out there but it at least made sense to a degree. This one made zero sense for the majority of its plot points

Especially that lawyer scene. Holy shit I was ripping my eyes out at that point. â€œThereâ€™s literally nothing you can doâ€ bitch what yes tf there is. â€œIâ€™m sorry these t&câ€™s are watertightâ€ bitch no tf they are not terms and conditions do not hold up the way youâ€™re making them out and definitely the fuck not in a situation like this

Also, â€œyou have a phone with you all the time right ðŸ¤“ you know when youâ€™re talking about fucking jalapeÃ±os and next thing you know youâ€™re seeing ads for jalapeÃ±os ðŸ¤“ well thatâ€™s how they know what youâ€™re doingâ€ fuck right off. If my eyes rolled any more than they already did at this point then they would have fallen out my head

Another thing that made me feel like I was going completely insane. â€œStreamberryâ€ exposed themselves when they showed the episode with this lawyer scene. They literally told all their subscribers what they are â€œtechnically allowed to doâ€ and what do these people do? They stay subscribed of-course. And then have the audacity to act shocked when they find out they also have a show just for them. I mean come the fuck on. Could you imagine the public backlash if Netflix actually did something like this? They simply wouldnâ€™t get away with it. They make money from public perception and the way the public perceives them would sink through the floor after something like this

I donâ€™t usually feel like this. I can suspend my disbelief if needed, itâ€™s fine. But thereâ€™s a difference between suspending disbelief and pretending to be an insane person

now you're applying game logic to a alien lifeform, of course the devs are not going to simulate actual sonar just for the couple of fauna that uses it, but it is stated in the game that reapers have shit eyes and use echolocation. bats have decent eyesight too but they're considered blind anyways because its shit and you dont need eyesight to tell which side is the back of something, any manner of vision will do, we even have another user in this thread telling you theyre blind, whether you choose to believe that or not is up to you, if this meme is so illogical and wrong in your eyes then just move on, but i personally wont continue an arguement about this meme i made on 3am brain cells",-0.02591860465116279,-1

OhhZio,"True I think personally what I stated in the previous replies makes it worth it :) it is all personal preference and opinion though that determines worth. I record YouTube videos, Stream, make montages. When I send videos to editors to get edited they have to be of quality to have effects and stuff done to them. When recorded with a handheld jailbroken vita broadcasting to obs with no upscaled video at 29.97 fps is not favorable for editors to work with. Itâ€™s easier and more preferable within the montage scene to have regular aspect ratio and quality. Hope this makes sense!

Edit: in fact Iâ€™d argue itâ€™s one of the only reasons to have a pstv aside from obviously controller and tv play, those are probably the ONLY 3 reasons to have a pstv.",0.028367948717948715,1
OhhZio,Youâ€™re welcome! A lot of the handheld vita obs recordings look really bad because itâ€™s not upscaled at all to be played back on anything other than a handheld vita.

In terms of the colors, I'm not really a fan of all their different colors like on their mobile app. It feels a bit messy and overwhelming, like they have so much stuff being thrown at the viewer.

SomeBoricuaDude,"I used to belong at an AV org that was started by my school's director and ran by a few of my friends. I joined during its second year of existence and while we did a lot of really cool stuff (I was one of their staff photographers and I was given the task to create, run, host and supervise a sports podcast), we never did get the chance to do shorts or learn anything of the sorts. We did however do a lot of technical work that is also present in filmmaking, for every episode of any given podcast we'd have to set up the lightning, employ set design, use lavs as well as stage mics, set up OBS, YouTube, etc etc. I wasn't present in all of them but from what I can gather from the other podcasts the entire process was the same, save for one that got our interviewers to work with local personalities and athletes, in which they'd have to move the entire setup from the studio to whatever place they'd choose for the interview. As for the equipment we got to work with cameras all the time. I had mine with me most of the time I was in a tournament, but by the end of the year I started using their Canon EOS 3000. In general I learned a lot of stuff there that I normally wouldn't have known while working on a short, mainly just how to operate a camera effectively and knowing how to use it.

So if you got your students to work an AV club I would suggest you get them to work on school broadcasts. Tournaments, announcements, graduations, nothing is really out of the picture. As long as you get the ball rolling with em and have them on the team there's a lot of stuff you can do with making short films/teaching students about films as the end goal. You need equipment first and for that you need a budget. We didn't have a problem with that because the mod was the school director, but in your case I think you'll need to show the school administration that your project is worth funding, and it's going to be a investment that'll benefit them in the long run. Starting out with covering school events like I mentioned earlier might be the best route because you'll essentially be the school's PR team. 

Once the equipment is there I suggest, and I say this with the best intentions, to lead the club yourself and NOT let your students run it until they learn how, effectively. I'd take a bullet for them, but those friends of mine who I mentioned earlier were absolutely not fit for the job and did not execute properly, even with all the resources they had at their disposal. They didn't have anything written down on paper, they did not have a fully functional directive and there were a lot of internal disputes that had a lot of aftereffects on a lot of things. I wasn't a fan of how they were running the entire thing so I asked one of them if I could be in one of their meetings. The first one told me I could, the second told me I couldn't and when I went back to the first he told me that, no, I couldn't. Their reasoning? It was an internal affair. Keep in mind, this was right before they gave me the podcast. Then when you go over to the photography part of things it gets rather worse.

One of the photographers on the job used editing software in post, she was the only one who took the photos home after a tourney. And she was good at it. She was arguably the best photographer in the entire school. One day, during a basketball tournament, one of my buddies told her that that she couldn't take the photos with her bc they wanted them to come out on time. 

For context, part of the entire operation is for us to take the photos and get them out as fast as possible. When one game ended and the other one began, they already had the photos out by the second to third quarter. So when she told them that it wasn't possible, it became a problem with them, and she quit afterwards. 

Eventually they got her back, but the entire ordeal got me thinking about my photos, and how some of them weren't even coming out because of that release policy. Overall, these guys were in charge of running a massive endeavor and they didn't deliver. On the surface they did but on an organizational level it was an absolute catastrophe. 

Considering all of this, I think you should run a tight ship and choose your leaders wisely if you decide to start that way. Once you get to making student films it'll be much easier since everyone will be familiarized with the equipment and the process of producing media, you'll just need to get them to understand the narrative and performance basics of filmmaking.",0.013192727272727273,1
SomeBoricuaDude,"Submission statement: This is the teaser trailer for The Field Street Registers, a no budget homemade short series I've been working on since I was a junior, when it was a short film that I'd been working on since the summer of 2021. My ambition for it grew the summer before I became a senior, so I split it in a three-episode (now four) short series. It has a budget of \~$700 (just the DSLR) and since we started shooting it we've been doing some on and off work on it.

It's my third project (8th if you're counting stuff that never came out) so I've been pretty invested in making this worthwhile. This teaser trailer was made last May, when I thought I could get it out by the end of the month. That didn't happen, but it's still coming out this year. All of the people you see on camera are not a part of the film industry (including myself â˜»ï¸) so don't expect something that comes from the actual pros, some of which have been kind enough to show their work here.

If you've watched it, please tell me what you think of it. I would like to hear some opinions, I'm still editing and shooting some stuff left over from the summer so I'd like to know where I could improve. Negative or positive!

If you haven't watched it (and if you have the time of course), watch these two short films before taking a look at the teaser. They are part of the same narrative and the show (as well as the trailer) builds upon the characters and the world. They're not pretty good but once you watch the trailer it will be worth it.

SomeBoricuaDude,"It's a generous 7/10, personally I think it had a VERY promising launch (good campaign, 16 MP maps on launch, grindable operator skins, etc etc) but Zombies and a decline in attention over the following months made it very stale. Multiplayer specifically didn't hit the highs from its launch/Season 1 ever again and a lot of maps and modes were cut. It got hit very hard by Warzone, unlike Cold War which managed to bounce back in Season 3. Mix with that the fact that it carries over a lot of the Warzone era features (EOMM/SBMM, Bundles, focus on pandering to campers, gunsmith and more) and you have a game that could've been as great as its predecessor but it also never could due to the time in which it was made.

Accurate-Row-8539,"1- I never expected the game to look like Forza Horizon or any other game made with Unreal Engine 4/5, but they are nowhere near mobile game quality. The game graphic quality/looks are similar to the ones found in The Crew Motorfest (I played the closed beta).

4 - Traffic density can litteraly be fixed with very few if any lines of code...

5 - No other arcade style game offers a fuel system, why is it a let down in this case?

In the Defective Edition, there is no theme at all; it feels like summer. All three games of the DE edition play and feel the same; none of the games retain the classic gamesâ€™ theme, they all feel identical, like cheap clones. On top of this, the lighting, visuals, and character models are terrible looking. The gameplay is still janky, combat is janky, and the aiming is bad.

Movement: Boots on the ground and fast paced. Bring back side dashing from AW but just have it so the operator does a quick strafe from side to side (rather than using a jetpack for it)

Perks: Ghostsâ€™ perk system was underrated imo, Iâ€™d welcome that back

TTK: Cold War. Perfect time to react to enemies

Prestige system: Classic like the older CoDs, but with more rewards. Instead of just getting a calling card + permanent unlock every prestige, reward us with some nice blueprints or operator skins

NeoStark,"VGC updated their article with some info:

* Lead combat designer Mihir Sheth recently told the publication that one of Santa Monica Studioâ€™s internal philosophies is the idea that â€œKratos plays with his foodâ€.
* He explained: â€œWe tried to create systems you want to engage with that are fun, very playful, lots of different routes. And when we looked at the combat in the last game, we were like, â€˜We can push this further; we can find new toys and ways of playing with enemies and strategies.â€™ Thatâ€™s been the guiding principle more than anything else.â€
* Sheth said one way the sequel does this is by introducing â€œa whole new suite of movesâ€ for Kratos which are accessible via the triangle button.

Spuriusrex,"I was fortunate in high school to where I had a wonderful large group of friends, mainly of the â€œpreppy crowdâ€ - we were all bandies (marching band, concert band, jazz band, etc.) Actually the entire top 20 of my class, essentially, was my friend group. Mix of guys and girls. For big parties, weâ€™d all be there, but within this group were sub-groups. Some people Iâ€™d never hang out with, just with them. You know how it is. Over time, we incorporated in some other friends, from the grade beneath us and above us. Diverse group. 

Well, me and a chunk of the guys of that group were extra close. We would hang in groups of 3-4 every day, sometimes 5-6. We werenâ€™t partiers nor did we drink underage really, at least not at 16. Around junior year, we all sort of found humor in being neighborhood nuisances. What started as simple shenanigans, where we would go out late at night and ding-dong-ditch houses, quickly evolved into something much bigger. Borrowing from Step Brothers, we found a love for â€œfucking shit upâ€ and weâ€™d TP lawns, weâ€™d â€œforkâ€ yards (buy a box of plastic cutlery and scatter it in someoneâ€™s front yard at night), and that evolved into stupid shit like carrying a roadside couch up a block and stuffing it into someoneâ€™s truck bed. We had a lot of fun just moving around roadside junk, furniture, boxes, etc. We gave it a nickname, we called it FSU for (fuck shit up) and weâ€™d text each other/ask each other during the day, â€œhey, FSU tonight?â€ So, weâ€™d all meet up wherever we were crashing, chill all night, play Halo or CoD, maybe fuck with people on Omegle, and then all (or almost all) of us would go out at like 2am for a night of FSU. And weâ€™d dress in dark clothes and get a game plan. Weâ€™d try to stay off the streets (rural northeast but not countryside; almost like suburban but not a suburb to a greater city). A lot of adrenaline-fueled sprints through backyards. Weâ€™d never get too far from the home we were sleeping at so that we could run if we needed to. Weâ€™d traverse only nearby blocks. Weâ€™d basically go until we were tired, until we ran out of ideas or things to do, or until we were forced to retreat back because porch lights were coming on/residents had come outside. I remember one instance where two of my friends set off a works bomb in someoneâ€™s front yard, continued walking through the neighborhood, looped back maybe a half hour later, and cops were speaking to the nearby residents who heard it go off. I can recall numerous times where weâ€™d TP a tree, continue on with our excursions, suddenly hear patrol car sirens/see lights, and weâ€™d sprint back to wherever we were staying, dive into the fenced in backyard, and peer through the bushes as patrol cars would scope out the neighborhood for a good 10 minutes. 

Some of my friends took things several steps too far and it got too much like minor vandalism and less like simply inconveniencing people.

Anyways, fast forward a few months and I come across a segment in the local newspaper about how my neighborhood was forming a neighborhood watch in response to reports of juvenile delinquents being pests to neighborhood residents. 

Tl;dr - In high school, my group of guy friends and I would go out late at night and mess with people. From simple things like ding-dong-ditch, to more asinine things like putting a roadside microwave in someoneâ€™s driveway. Due to our antics, a neighborhood watch was formed.",0.013313315217391309,1

He had an open blister on his heel and after he fell asleep under the futon, my friend proceeded to spray almost all of the Axe body spray can on his open blister. He didnâ€™t wake up. Iâ€™m assuming the blister took a while to heal because I remember him having a limp for a few days.

afriendfuryou,"I have a straight friend who knows I'm gay and he used to make a lot of flirts towards me just because he knew it'd get to me. Lol

I'm still in the closet with my family, but my siblings probably already know because just the other day we went to a dollar tree and they handed me a book titled Accepting Yourself in 5 Fab Steps, and deadpan just went ""This is for you"" before laughing at my flustered, denial reaction.",0.04839565217391304,1

afriendfuryou,"I honestly have thought about this a lot, and I think Cod, in order to mix up the formula, needs to make at least one game stepping away from traditional wars and either do something on the modern war on crime, the war on drugs, or the prohibition gang wars. Something like a cops vs. robbers, cops vs. drug gangs, or prohibition mobs vs other mobs or cops would be a welcome and interesting change.

Still not buying the next cod though after what Activision did to SM2 and XLabs.. lol",-0.024475438596491234,-1

afriendfuryou,"I can understand this to an extent. I admit that opening up is a bit of a different story since I'm able to hold it in to an extent, if that makes sense; like, I still get that sudden sense of impending doom and terror that happen for seemingly no reason, but I'm able to like, tell my body to push through it until I have the space and time to where it wouldn't be a nuisance to anyone. I understand though that's not something everyone can do, and I admit I wasn't able to fully control it last time it happened. I guess I've never opened up about it to anyone irl because I've never been in a situation where I was forced to explain it. 

I am very sorry though to all those who are often forced into situations where they may end up feeling embarrassed over having awkward and public panic episodes. I understand that those are very hard to go through and make you feel exposed and vulnerable when you have them. For those that struggle on that level, I will be praying for you.",-0.02036138613861386,-1

afriendfuryou,"Seems to depend who you ask, since it's a political term.

For those on the left, it meant (or at least used to mean, since they don't really use this term anymore) having ""waken up"" to the injustices and dangers of our societal systems, such as general government, law enforcement, capitalism, the patriarchy, etc. 

From what I've observed, it was later canned by the left after being used on the right to describe someone who is far left (which tbf, it was a phrase the far left used to describe themselves since they were the ones who considered most of the west's societal structures as corrupt).",-0.018309999999999996,-1

Just fucking acted like any and all rules didn't apply to him and got in trouble all the time, then is surprised and upset when his actions have consequences..

afriendfuryou,"Yeah, though that was partially because the devs for that had a chance of making money off of what they made.

SM2 was being developed via volunteer work and they didn't even have a Patreon for donations. sM2 was just a passion project done in the spare time of a bunch of modders. 

So this feels particularly scummy of Activision.",0.03349333333333333,1
